<!--
  - SuppressionFilter to ignore some checks for some files. This is typically used to allow test
  - case classes to be less strict. However, do _not_ suppress any checks for production code !

    <!--
      - Ignore magic number checking for test cases. This is consistent with tests that define test
      - data in Spring context files. However, developers should ensure that test data objects are
      - still meaningfully named.
